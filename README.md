# Universities-Data-Analysis-and-K-Means-Clustering-Project
In this project we attempt to use K-Means Clustering to cluster Universities into to two groups; Private and Public.  Libraries used in this project: Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Pandas.   

#### It is important to note that we actually have the labels for the dataset, but will NOT use them for the K-Means clustering algorithm, since it is an unsupervised learning algorithm.   When using the K-means algorithm under normal circumstances, it is with data that does not have labels. In our case we will use the labels with an attempt to see how well the algorithm performed.  Since a classification report is usually not generated for K-means clustering, the classification report and confusion matrix at the end of the project will not truly make real world sense.  

This project was done through Jose Portilla (head of Data Science at Pierian Data Inc.) on Udemy (Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp).
